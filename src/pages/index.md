      - title: Psychometric Assessments
        content: >
          We know that psychometric assessment data is one of the most powerful
          ways of **predicting job performance and culture fit**.  


          We help you to **make sense of this data** and  to **increase your
          liklihood of making a good hire** by integrating assessment data with
          other methods of selection (and your gut feel), and to plan and craft
          your next stages of interview, reference checks and on-boarding.

      - title: Leadership Coaching
        content: >
          Are leaders born or made? While some of us might seem more natural
          than others, we believe in the **potential for growth and
          development** within all of us, including the great leaders among
          us.  


          Leadership coaching is a **high impact** and **high accountability**
          approach to developing an individual's personal leadership capability,
          and embed new and helpful behaviours that will maintain a virtuous,
          upward spiral.  This almost always begins with honest self-reflective,
          personal insights, and an exploration of the individual **why**.
